Data and code for "The Reputational Penalty: How Fact-Checking Can Penalize Those Who Spread Misinformation"

Note that Annika Davies, Ethan Porter, and I conducted three studies. In Study 1, we ran a single survey. In Study 2, we ran two survey waves and then merged together data for respondents who took both. In Study 3, we ran two completely separate surveys. In the first, we identified which political activists have higher and lower name recognition. In the second, we ran the main analysis in this study. Using data from all three studies, we ran a meta-analysis of the effects of fact-checking Seth Gruber on attitudes toward him.

Note that all public versions of datasets have personally identifiable information removed.
